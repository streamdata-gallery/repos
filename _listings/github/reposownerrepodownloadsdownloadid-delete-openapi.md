        This method returns the contents of a file or directory in a repository.
        Files and symlinks support a custom media type for getting the raw content.
        Directories and submodules do not support custom media types.
        Note: This API supports files up to 1 megabyte in size.
        Here can be many outcomes. For details see "http://developer.github.com/v3/repos/contents/"
